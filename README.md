# COVID-19 Data Visualization
## Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] is an highly infectious disease which is believed to have been originated
from a wet market in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Since its outbreak, COVID-19 has spread
to almost all countries throughout the world. Because of its human-to-human transmission nature and no
vaccine currently available for its treatment, it has caused havoc in the world leading to lockdowns, shutting
of businesses in various countries. As part of this project, multiple static and animated visualizations are
created to show the outbreak, spread of COVID-19 as well as fatalities caused by it in various countries. The
visualizations also reveal how virus spread rate differed from one country to another and how the containment
measures such as lockdown imposed by China helped to flatten its curve, which is the need of the hour.

## Data Used
The dataset used for the visualization comprises of daily coronavirus cases observations from 22 January
2020 to 26 March 2020 for every affected country. The dataset is provided by Johns Hopins University [2]
and is made publicly available at [3].
